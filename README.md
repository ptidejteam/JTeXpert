# JTeXpert is a software testing tool that has developed to automatically generate a complete test suite towards satisfying the branch coverage criterion for a given Java class. JTeXpert is based on some sophisticated techniques of search based software testing. It is able to achieve a high code coverage comparing to the state of the art. JTeXpert is available as an executable jar file and open source code. It takes as inputs a Java file (.java) or a Java project directory and for every class under test, it automatically produces a test-case suite in JUnit format.
